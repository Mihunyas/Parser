One problem I've run into is returning a positive result whether or not a parameter is in the line.</p>\n<p>These two lines are both extrusions (squirting plastic), but one has the &quot;F&quot; parameter in it.  The parameters will sometimes be integers, and other times they will be floats.  The X, Y, and E parameters may be negative or positive.</p>\n<pre><code>G1 F3000 X123.45 Y123.45 E123.45678\nG1 X-200.00 Y200.00 E222.34567\n</code></pre>\n<p>This pattern kind of works, but fails for the second example where the &quot;F&quot; parameter is missing (which is most of the time).</p>\n<pre><code>G1 F(\\d+\\.\\d+|\\d+) X(-?\\d+\\.\\d+|-?\\d+) Y(-?\\d+\\.\\d+|-?\\d+) E(-?\\d+\\.\\d+|-?\\d+)\n</code></pre>\n<p>One problem looks to be that when the &quot;F&quot; parameter is missing, the pattern has an extra &quot;space&quot; character.  My workaround has been to use an IF statement, but it just looks clumsy.\nI tried putting a &quot;|&quot; in hoping for &quot;If F or not F&quot; but haven't gotten that to work.</p>\n<p>A second part of this would be; how do I return values from (for example) the &quot;X&quot; parameter?</p>\n",
